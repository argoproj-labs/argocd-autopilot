# v0.2.15

- The cluster-resources application-set should not have an empty project value [#165](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/165)
- Creating a DirApp with an existing name overwrites the previous application [#158](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/158)
- Creating a DirApp with no path in the repo causes app to not be created in the cluster [#166](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/166)

### Dependencies:

- Default bootstrap now installs Argo-CD 2.1.1 and ApplicationSet 0.2.0 [#168](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/168)

# v0.2.14

### New featues:

- Allow adding labels for the ArgoCD app created during the bootstrap [#159](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/159)

### Dependencies:

- Bump k8s.io/api from 0.21.1 to 0.21.3 [#135](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/135)
- Bump k8s.io/kubectl from 0.21.1 to 0.21.3 [#137](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/137)
- Bump github.com/briandowns/spinner from 1.13.0 to 1.16.0 [#149](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/149)

# v0.2.13

### New Features:

- Allow installation of Argo-CD in `insecure` mode (useful when you want the SSL termination to happen in the ingress controller)[#144](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/144)

### Breaking Changes:

- Removed the `--namespaced` option from `repo bootstrap`. Installing argo-cd in namespaced mode cannot be used for bootstraping as the bootstrap installation contains CRDs, which are cluster scoped resources, which cannot be created by argo-cd in namespaced mode. Bottom line: it was never useable.

# v0.2.12

### New Features:

- Allow sending extra key-value pairs to app create [138](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/138)

### Documentation fixes:

- update url path to core_concepts docs [#141](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/141)

# v0.2.11

### Bug fixes:

- fixed provider sort order in field description text [#131](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/131)

# v0.2.10

### New Features:

- Support gitea as a SCM provider [#129](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/129)

### Bug fixes:

- `repo bootstrap` fails when running argocd login if passing different --kubeconfig argument [#125](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/125)

# v0.2.9

### New Features:

- Add an repo uninstall command to argocd-autopilot [#42](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/42) - Running this command will delete all manifest files and directory structure from the GitOps Repository, and all the resources from the k8s cluster

### Additional Features:

- improve sanity check [#119](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/119) - runs `repo bootstrap` on every push. Also fixed ClusterRoleBinding now being applied correctly

# v0.2.8

### Breaking Changes:

- Removed `repo create` command. From now on, the `repo bootstrap` command will automatically create the repository if it currently does not exist. A new `--provider` flag was added to this command, in order to specificy the git cloud provider to use when creating the repository. Autopilot currently only supports github. Without the flag value, autopilot will try to infer the provider from the repo URL. [116](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/116)

### New Features:

- The `app create` now supports waiting for the Application to be fully Synced to the k8s cluster. The standard kubeclient flags were added in order to specificy which context is expected to recieve the new Application, and a `--wait-timeout` flag can set the duration to wait before returning an error. The default value of 0 will not perform any wait, nor require access to the cluster at all. [117](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/117)

# v0.2.7

### Bug Fixes:

- url_parse_fix [#106](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/106)

# v0.2.6

### Bug Fixes:

- getting "failed to build bootstrap manifests" since v0.2.5 [#106](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/106)

### Breaking Changes:

- ~when sending `--app` flag value, use either `?sha=<sha_value>`, `?tag=<tag_name>` or `?ref=<branch_name>` to specificy sha|tag|branch to clone from ~ [#98](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/98)~ - REVERTED in [#107](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/107)

### Additional Changes:

- fixed help text typos [#105](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/105)

# v0.2.2

### Bug fixes:

- App type infer fails when --app value references a tag [#97](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/97)
- Deleting the bootstrap app hangs while deleting the entire hierarchy [#99](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/99)

### Breaking Changes:

- when sending `--app` flag value, use either `?sha=<sha_value>`, `?tag=<tag_name>` or `?ref=<branch_name>` to specificy sha|tag|branch to clone from [#98](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/98)

### Additional changes:

- update docs about secrets not yet supported [#93](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/pull/93)
- Support using 2 repos for Kustomize apps [#97](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/97)

# v0.2.1

### Bug fixes:

- app create does not work with local path (tries to infer application type by cloning) [#87](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/87)
- Clone logs not displaying correct values
- Debug logs not showing

### Additional changes:

- Updated k8s dependencies from v0.20.4 to v0.21.1
- Added `--progress` flag to redirect the git operations
- `CloneOptions.FS` is now `fs.FS` instead of `billy.Filesystem`

# v0.2.0

### Breaking Changes:

- Combined `--repo`, `--installation-path` and `--revision` into a single url, set by `--repo` with the following syntax:

```
argocd-autopilot <command> --repo https://github.com/owner/name/path/to/installation_path?ref=branch
```

The `REPO_URL` environment variable also uses the new syntax

### Bug fixes:

- failed to build bootstrap manifests [#82](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/82)
- Adding two applications with the same ns causes sync ping-pong [#23](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/issues/23)

### Additional changes:
