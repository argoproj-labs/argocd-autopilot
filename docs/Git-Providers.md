# Git Providers

Autopilot fully automates the installation process and bootstrapping of Argo CD, it can even create and initialize a git repository if required, but to do so it needs to have access to your git provider.

The following git providers are currently supported:

* Github
* Gitlab
* Bitbucket Server (on-prem only)
* Azure DevOps
* Gitea
